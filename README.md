Intro
-----
Cfacoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin,
with the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin using the Libzerocoin extention,
Cfacoin will be  Proof-Of-Work until block 100000,
then it became pure Proof-Of-Stake.
