UNIX BUILD NOTES
================
Dependencies
------------
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libdb++-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev libminiupnpc-dev -y
sudo apt-get install qt5-default qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
[Press Enter]

Note: you will require at least 2GB of RAM or a swap file to compile.

To Build
--------
Clone Latest Repo
git clone https://github.com/node1coza/cfacoin.git
(This should download the latest official repo to a cfacoin folder)

cd cfacoin/src
(change in to the Peepcoin Source folder)

To make both Headless Cfacoin (cfacoind) and the Cfacoin Wallet (cfacoin-qt), as well as shrink down your file size (strip), you can enter:
make -f makefile.unix cfacoind cfacoin-qt strip

Or to make them seperately:

Headless cfacoin (cfacoind)
make -f makefile.unix
strip cfacoind

Qt GUI Wallet (cfacoin-qt)
make -f makefile.unix cfacoin-qt strip

OR

cd ..
qmake -makefile Cfacoin-qt.pro
make
strip cfacoin-qt

This will leave you with cfacoind (the daemon) in your /cfacoin/src/ folder and cfacoin-qt (the QT wallet) in your /cfacoin/ folder

Configure cfacoin.conf to add nodes using nano text editor:
nano ~/.cfacoin/cfacoin.conf



Paste the addnode list from there into your ~/.cfacoin/cfacoin.conf. Ctrl + X to save. Y and then Enter to save file.

Launch your cfacoin-qt through the GUI or in terminal:
cd ~/cfacoin/
./cfacoin-qt

Launch your cfacoin-qt through the GUI or in terminal:
cd ~/cfacoin/src/
./cfacoind


Dependencies Info
-----------------

 Library     Purpose           Description
 -------     -------           -----------
 libssl      SSL Support       Secure communications
 libdb       Berkeley DB       Blockchain & wallet storage
 libboost    Boost             C++ Library
 miniupnpc   UPnP Support      Optional firewall-jumping support
 libqrencode QRCode generation Optional QRCode generation

Note that libexecinfo should be installed, if you building under *BSD systems. 
This library provides backtrace facility.

miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is compiled in and
turned off by default.  Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:
 USE_UPNP=-    No UPnP support - miniupnp not required
 USE_UPNP=0    (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime
 USE_UPNP=1    UPnP support turned on by default at runtime

libqrencode may be used for QRCode image generation. It can be downloaded
from http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en, or installed via
your package manager. Set USE_QRCODE to control this:
 USE_QRCODE=0   (the default) No QRCode support - libqrcode not required
 USE_QRCODE=1   QRCode support enabled

Licenses of statically linked libraries:
 Berkeley DB   New BSD license with additional requirement that linked
               software must be free open source
 Boost         MIT-like license
 miniupnpc     New (3-clause) BSD license


Detailed Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
-------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev

If using Boost 1.37, append -mt to the boost libraries in the makefile.


Dependency Build Instructions: Gentoo
-------------------------------------

emerge -av1 --noreplace boost openssl sys-libs/db

Take the following steps to build (no UPnP support):
 cd ${CFACOIN_DIR}/src
 make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=
 strip cfacoind


Notes
-----
The release is built with GCC and then "strip cfacoind" to strip the debug
symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.


miniupnpc
---------
tar -xzvf miniupnpc-1.6.tar.gz
cd miniupnpc-1.6
make
sudo su
make install


Berkeley DB
-----------
You need Berkeley DB. If you have to build Berkeley DB yourself:
../dist/configure --enable-cxx
make


Boost
-----
If you need to build Boost yourself:
sudo su
./bootstrap.sh
./bjam install


Security
--------
To help make your peepcoin installation more secure by making certain attacks impossible to
exploit even if a vulnerability is found, you can take the following measures:

* Position Independent Executable
    Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization
    offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause execution of code at an arbitrary
    memory location is thwarted if he doesn't know where anything useful is located.
    The stack and heap are randomly located by default but this allows the code section to be
    randomly located as well.

    On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this will cause an error
    such as: "relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can not be used when making a shared object;"

    To build with PIE, use:
    make -f makefile.unix ... -e PIE=1

    To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of paxutils, and use:
    scanelf -e ./peepcoin

    The output should contain:
     TYPE
    ET_DYN

* Non-executable Stack
    If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow exploits are possible if
    vulnerable buffers are found. By default, peepcoin should be built with a non-executable stack
    but if one of the libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake
    and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will silently build an
    executable without the non-executable stack protection.

    To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use:
    scanelf -e ./peepcoin

    the output should contain:
    STK/REL/PTL
    RW- R-- RW-

    The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not executable.
